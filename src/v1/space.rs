//! This module provides functions for interacting with Kintone's space-related REST API endpoints.
//! It includes operations for managing spaces, threads, and thread comments.

/// Adds a new comment to a specific thread in a Kintone space.
///
/// This function creates a request to add a comment to a thread within a space.
/// The comment can include text and mentions of other users.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `space` - The ID of the Kintone space
/// * `thread` - The ID of the thread to add the comment to
/// * `comment` - The comment data including text and mentions
///
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// let comment = ThreadComment {
///     text: "This is a thread comment.".to_string(),
///     mentions: vec![],
/// };
/// let response = add_thread_comment(123, 456, comment).send(&client)?;
/// println!("Added thread comment with ID: {}", response.id);
/// ```
